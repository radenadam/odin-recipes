        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Indonesian street fried rice, known as "nasi goreng," is a vibrant and flavorful dish that showcases the country's rich culinary heritage. This popular street food typically combines day-old rice stir-fried with a savory blend of spices, including garlic, shallots, chili, and kecap manis (sweet soy sauce), creating a balance of sweet, salty, and spicy notes. Often cooked in small roadside stalls or food carts, it is commonly garnished with a fried egg on top, crispy prawn crackers, and fresh cucumber or tomato slices, offering a satisfying and hearty meal that reflects Indonesia's diverse flavors and resourceful cooking style.</p>
